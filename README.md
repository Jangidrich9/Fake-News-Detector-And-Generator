# üì∞ Fake News Detector & Generator using Generative AI & NLP

This project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with **Generative AI** to create a dual-purpose application that can **detect fake news** and **generate synthetic news text**. It leverages state-of-the-art transformer models like **GPT-2** and **RoBERTa** to showcase both sides of the fake news problem ‚Äî generation and detection.

## üöÄ What This Project Does

- **Detects Fake News:** Uses a fine-tuned RoBERTa model (`hamzab/roberta-fake-news-classification`) to classify input news text as real or fake.
- **Generates News Text:** Uses GPT-2 (`gpt2-medium`) to generate realistic-sounding news based on a user-provided prompt.
- **Interactive Notebook:** Clean and interactive notebook implementation with real-time model loading, detection, and generation functionalities.

## üß† Key Components

### 1. **Fake News Detection**
- üîç **Model Used:** RoBERTa fine-tuned on fake news classification.
- üìå **Pipeline:** `transformers.pipeline("text-classification")`
- üß™ **Usage:** Paste any news text, and the model will classify it as **REAL** or **FAKE**.

### 2. **Fake News Generation**
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Model Used:** `gpt2-medium`
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Pipeline:** `transformers.pipeline("text-generation")`
- üí¨ **Usage:** Input a topic like *"Breaking News: Government announces"* and GPT-2 generates a realistic news story continuation.

## üí° How it Works (Brief Overview)

- The notebook starts by installing and importing necessary libraries (`transformers`, `torch`, `pandas`).
- Models are dynamically loaded based on available GPU/CPU.
- Two separate pipelines are initialized:
  - `text_generator` for fake news generation.
  - `fake_news_detector` for classification.
- A clean interface allows users to run:
  - Custom prompts for generating news.
  - Custom news for checking authenticity.
- Results are displayed interactively using `IPython.display`.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Outputs

### ‚úÖ Fake News Detection
> **Input:** "COVID-19 vaccine causes magnetism in humans"  
> **Output:** FAKE

### üßæ Fake News Generation
> **Prompt:** "Breaking News: AI revolutionizes the healthcare sector"  
> **Generated Text:** *"...hospitals around the world have begun adopting AI-driven systems..."*

## üõ† Technologies & Libraries Used
